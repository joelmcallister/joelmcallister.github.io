Consider the following ODE

	`y^&#8243; + lambda y = 0`,      for some constant  `lambda in RR`.

An equivalence may be observed between this ODE and the eigenvalue equation from linear algebra

	`A bb x = lambda bb x`,

where the vector `bb x` is replaced with the (scalar) function `y`, and the matrix `A`
is replaced with the operator `-d^2/(dx^2)`.

(<b>N.B.</b> recall that both matrix multiplication and differentiation are linear transformations)

Thus, given certain boundary conditions, we may determine the eigenvalues and corresponding
<i>eigenfunctions</i> (since `y` is a function, not a vector) for the given ODE.

First though, we should determine the general solution to this equation, which can be split into three
cases.

	1)	Let  `lambda = -alpha^2`      `alpha in RR \ \\ \ {0}`   (`=> \ lambda < 0` ).

		Then the general solution becomes

			`y_(-)(x) = Acosh(alpha x) + Bsinh(alpha x)`,      for `A`, `B` arbitrary constants.
			
			(<b>N.B.</b> we may restrict to `alpha > 0` since `-alpha` yields the same `lambda` value
				 and the altered sign of `sinh` may be absorbed into the arbitrary constant)

	2)	Let `lambda = 0`.

		Then we have

			 `(d^2y)/(dx^2) = 0`

		`=>`  `y_0(x) = cx + d,`      for arbitrary constants `c` and `d`.

	3)	Let `lambda = beta^2`      `beta in RR \ \\ \ {0}`   (`=> \ lambda > 0` ).

		Then the general solution becomes

			`y_(+)(x) = Ecos(beta x) + Fsin(beta x)`,      for `E`, `F` arbitrary constants.

			(<b>N.B.</b> once again, we may restrict `beta` to the positive reals)

	The imposition of boundary conditions will fix the values of the arbitrary constants.

<b>N.B.</b> The <i>trivial</i> solution `lambda = 0` is not an eigenvalue, since an eigenvalue
	must be non-zero.

	In addition, as is the case with eigenvectors, one 

See the <a href="./assets/MT2720.week1.pdf">lecture notes</a> for examples.

<b>N.B.</b> Example 1.7 from the lecture notes has eigenvalues

		`lambda_n = n^2`,    `n in ZZ_(>=0)`

	with corresponding eigenfunctions given by

		`y_n(x) = { ("   " 1,"if  " n=0), ({{: (sinx), (cosx) :}}, "if  " n != 0) :}`

	where the bracket notation indicates that two linearly independent eigenfunctions
	<b>span</b> the <b>two-dimensional eigenspace</b> corresponding to the eigenvalue `lambda_n`, and
	that `lambda_n` has <b>multiplicity two</b>.
	
	In other words, a non-trivial linear combination of the functions shown is also an eigenfunction.

	For eigenvalue `lambda = 0` :

		`y(x) = Esin(nx) + Fcos(nx)`,    `n in NN`,

		for arbitrary constants `E, F` .
