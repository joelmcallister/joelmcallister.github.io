        <h3>Acceleration</h3>

        <in>
            Since `bb v = v bb T`, we may note the following about acceleration

            <in>
                `bb a(t) = (d bbv)/(dt) = (dv)/(dt) bb T + v (d bb T)/(dt)`
                &nbsp;
                <in style="margin-left: 88px"></in>`= (text(change of speed)) + (text(change of direction))`
            </in>

            Also note that the tangent vector is always orthogonal to its derivative w.r.t. `t`.

            <in>
                `d/(dt) (bb T * bb T) = 2 (bb T * (d bb T) / (dt)) = 0,` &nbsp; &nbsp; since `|bb T| = 1`
                &nbsp;
                `=> bb T _|_ (d bb T)/(dt)`
            </in>

            If we parameterise our equation in terms of arc length `s`, the relationship
            between `bb a` and `bb T` becomes much simpler (since `v(s) = 1 \ \ \ AA s`).

            <in>
                `bb a(s) = (d bb T)/(ds)`
            </in>
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Curvature and unit normal vector</h3>

        <in>
            We can thus define

            <in>
                `K(s) = |bb a(s)|`
                &nbsp;
                `bb N(s) = (bb a(s)) / (|bb a(s)|) = (bb a(s)) / (K(s))`
            </in>

            where `K` represents to the magnitude of `bb a` and `bb N` represents its direction.
            
            <b>N.B.</b> the above defintion is only applicable when working in a parameterisation
            <in></in> w.r.t. the arc length `s`.

            `bb N` is commonly referred to as the <b>unit normal vector</b>, since `bb T` is
            orthogonal to its derivative w.r.t. `s`, and thus `bb a(s)` and `bb N(s)` are normal to
            the curve at point `P: (x, y)`.

            <in>
                `bb N _|_ bb T`
                &nbsp;
            </in>

            `K` is known as as the <b>curvature</b> at point `P: (x, y)`.

            <b>N.B.</b> for a circle of radius `R`, &nbsp; &nbsp; `bb N = -bb r/R`, &nbsp; and so the unit normal vector
            <in></in> `bb N` always points towards the center of the circle.
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Tangent and osculation</h3>

        <in> &nbsp;
            `C'` is tangential to `C` at `P` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `<=>` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `bb r(s_0) = bb r'(s_0')` &nbsp; &nbsp; and &nbsp; &nbsp; `[(d bb r)/(ds)]_(s_0) = [(d bb r')/(ds')]_(s_0')`
            &nbsp;
            `C'` osculates `C` at `P` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `<=>` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `C'` is tangential to `C` at `P` &nbsp; &nbsp; and &nbsp; &nbsp; `[(d^2 bb r)/(ds^2)]_(s_0) = [(d^2 bb r')/(ds'^2)]_(s_0')`
            &nbsp;
            <in style="margin-left: 181px"></in>`<=>` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `C'` is tangential to `C` at `P` &nbsp; &nbsp; and &nbsp; &nbsp; `K(s_0) = K'(s_0')` &nbsp; &nbsp; and &nbsp; &nbsp; `bb N(s_0) = bb N'(s_0')`
            &nbsp;
            <in style="margin-left: 500px"></in>(" same `bb N` and `K` at `P` ")
            
            <b>N.B.</b> &nbsp; to "osculate" means to kiss.
            &nbsp;
            The tangent to a curve is a line, whereas a curve is osculated by a circle,
            known as the "osculating circle".

            The curvature of `C` is inversely proportional to the radius of `D`, the circle
            which it osculates

            <in>
                `K(s) = 1/(rho(s))`
                &nbsp;
            </in>
            <b>N.B.</b> &nbsp; `rho` is known as the <b>radius of curvature</b>.

            The unit normal vector `bb N` points towards the center of `D`.
            &nbsp;
        </in>
