        <h3>Transposition rules</h3>

        <in>
            The following properties hold for `M^T`, the transpose of matrix `M`.
            <in> &nbsp;
                `(A + B)^T = A^T + B^T`
                &nbsp;
                `(AB)^T = B^T \ A^T`
                &nbsp;
            </in>

            <b>N.B.</b> &nbsp; a matrix `A` is called <b>symmetric</b> if `A^T = A`.
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Permutations</h3>

        <in>
            Consider the set `T_n = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}`.

            Then a <i>permutation</i> `alpha` on the set `\ T_n` is a bijection from itself to iteself.

            <in>
                `alpha: \ \ \ T_n -> T_n,` &nbsp; &nbsp; `"where" \ \  alpha \ \ "is bijective"`
                &nbsp;
            </in>

            <b>N.B.</b> &nbsp; permutations may be composed or inverted as with ordinary mappings
            <in></in> &nbsp; (the mapping `alpha beta` corresponds to performing `beta` followed by `alpha`).

            We may use the following notation to represent a permutation:

            <in>
                `alpha = ((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), (2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 1))`
                &nbsp;
            </in>

            However, this notation is a little cumbersome, and so in general it is better to use
            <b>cycle notation</b> (as described below).
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Cycles</h3>

        <in> &nbsp;
            <h4>Cycle</h4>

            <in>
                If you iteratively apply a permutation to a given element in the set,
                the element will be mapped to various other elements in the set, before
                finally returning to the original element. Intuitively, this process is
                referred to as a cycle.

                In the worst case, an element would be mapped through all the other
                elements in the set before it returns to its original value. This is
                referred to as a cycle of order `n`.

                <in>
                    `a = alpha^t (a)`
                </in>
                &nbsp;
            </in>
            
            <h4>Cycle length</h4>

            <in>
                The length of a cycle is the number of iterations it takes to complete
                a full loop (i.e. return to the original value).
                &nbsp;
            </in>

            <h4>Cycle decomposition</h4>

            <in>
                A given set will have a finite number of cycles which each element
                falls into. Also, each element will fall into exactly one cycle
                (and thus cycles may be referred to as disjoint from each other).
                We can decompose a set into its constituent cycles.
                &nbsp;
            </in>

            <h4>Cycle type</h4>

            <in>
                The cycle type is a list of the lengths of each of the cycles comprising `alpha`.
            </in>
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Cycle representation <span class="normal">of a permutation</span></h3>
        
        <in>
            The cycle

            <in>
                `beta = ((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), (1, 3, 6, 5, 4, 2))`
            </in>

            may be written in cycle notation as

            <in>
                `beta = (\ 2 \ \ 3 \ \ 6 \ )\ (\ 4 \ \ 5 \ )`
            </in>

            where each bracket contains an individual cycle.
            This notation represents our permutation as a <b>product of disjoint cycles</b>.

            <b>N.B.</b> &nbsp; Notice that `1` can be omitted from the representation, since it
            <in></in> &nbsp; forms a cycle of length one.
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Cycle order</h3>

        <in>
            A permutation `T_n` is said to be a cycle of order `r`, if it cyclically permutes
            `r` elements, and fixes all the rest.

            <in>
                `(\ 2 \ \ 5 \ \ 3 \ )` is a cycle of order `3`.
                &nbsp;
            </in>

            <h4>Special cases</h4>

            <in> &nbsp;
                <h4>Case `r=1`</h4> &nbsp; &nbsp; all the elements are <b>fixed</b> under `T_n`.
                &nbsp;
                <h4>Case `r=2` &nbsp; &nbsp; </h4>(<b>transposition</b>)</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>swaps</b> two of the elements, and fixes all the rest.
                &nbsp;
                <h4>Case `r=n`</h4> &nbsp; &nbsp; all the elements in the set form <b>one cycle</b> under `T_n`.
            </in>
        </in>
