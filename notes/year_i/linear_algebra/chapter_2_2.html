        <h3>Eigenvectors and eigenvalues</h3>

        <in> &nbsp;
            An <b>eigenvector</b> of a square matrix `A` is any non-zero vector `bb v` such that

            <in>
                `A bb v = lambda bb v` .
            </in>

            for some field value `lambda`, which is in turn referred to as the associated <b>eigenvalue</b>.

            The distinctive geometrical characteristic of an eigenvector is that its direction will not change
            under the corresponding linear transformation - its length will simply be scaled by some associated
            eigenvalue.

            Developing the above equation, we get

            <in>
                `A bb v = (lambda I) \ bb v`
                `A bb v - (lambda I) \ bb v = bb 0`
                `(A - lambda I) \ bb v = bb 0`
            </in>

            Since `bb v != bb 0` by definition, we may write

            <in>
                `det(A - lambda I) = 0`.
            </in>
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Diagonalization</h3>

        <in> &nbsp;
            Concentrating for now on the `2 xx 2` case, consider the matrix

            <in>
                `A = [(3, 1), (0, 2)]`
            </in>

            which has linearly independent eigenvectors `bb b_1 = [(1), (0)]`, `bb b_2 = [(1), (-1)]` with eigenvalues
            `3` and `2`, respectively.

            Form a square matrix `P` with vectors `bb b_1` and `bb b_2` as the two columns.

            <in>
                `P = [(1, 1), (0, -1)]`
            </in>

            We may now use this matrix to change our basis vectors to `bb b_1` and `bb b_2`.
            (see 3B1B's excellent videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">change of basis</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">eigenvectors</a>).

            <in>
                `D = P^(-1)AP`
            </in>

            Changing our basis vectors to eigenvectors has the advantage that only the diagonal of our matrix
            will be non-zero, since each basis vector is simply transformed into a <i>scaled version of itself</i>.

            As such, we refer to `D` as our <i>diagonalized</i> matrix.

            By noting that

            <in>
                <in></in>`D^n = P^(-1)A^nP`
                &nbsp;
                `=> A^n = PD^nP^(-1)`
            </in>

            (this can be proved by noting how adjacent `PP^(-1)` pairs cancel in the expansion of `D^n`)
            we now have a simple formula for the `n`<sup>th</sup> power of a diagonalizable matrix.

            Notice that

            <in>
                `P^(-1)AP = [(3, 0), (0, 2)]`.
            </in>

            Indeed, in general for any diagonalizable `2 xx 2` matrix `A`, and its eigenvector pair `P`,

            <in>
                `P^(-1)AP = [(lambda, 0), (0, mu)]`
            </in>

            where `lambda` and `mu` are the eigenvalues corresponding to each respective eigenvector in `P`.

            <b>N.B.</b> eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues must be linearly independent.
