        <h2>Matrices and linear maps</h2>
        &nbsp;
        <h3>Linear map (`RR^2 to RR^2`)</h3>

        <in>
            A linear map (<i>linear transformation</i>) from `RR^2` to `RR^2` is a map &nbsp;`f: RR^2 to RR^2` of the form

            <in>
                `[(x), (y)] |->  [(ax + by), (cx + dy)]` ,
            </in>

            which may be represented using the following matrix:

            <in>
                `[(a, b), (c, d)]` .
            </in>

            Then, we may define matrix-vector multiplication, such that

            <in>
                `[(a, b), (c, d)][(x), (y)]`
            </in>

            is equivalent to `f([(x), (y)])`.
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Linear map (`bbb F^n to bbb F^m`)</h3>

        <in>
            A linear map from `bbb F^n` to `bbb F^m` is a map of the shape `[(x_1), (x_2), (vdots), (x_n)] |-> [(y_1), (y_2), (vdots), (y_m)]`,

            where there is a fixed `m xx n` matrix `A = [a_(ij)]` over `bbb F` such that

            <in></in> `y_i = sum_(j=1)^n a_(ij) \ x_j \ \ (i = 1, 2, ..., m)`.
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Component Notation</h3>

        <in>
            The following two notational devices may be used to refer to the `(i, j)`<sup>th</sup> component of matrix `A`.

            <in>
                `i. \ \ \ [A]_(i,j)` &nbsp; (the comma may be omitted if there is no danger of confusion)
            </in>

            Let `A = [a_(ij)]`

            <in> &nbsp;
                `ii. \ \ a_(ij)`
            </in>
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Addition and scalar multiplication</h3>

        <in> &nbsp;
            `[A + B]_(ij) = [A]_(ij) + [B]_(ij)`
            &nbsp;
            `[lambda A]_(ij) = lambda [A]_(ij)`
            &nbsp;
            Matrices also satisfy the equivalents of the 9 <b>vector properties</b> covered in chapter 1.
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Matrix multiplication</h3>

        <in> &nbsp;
            It is very useful to think of matrix multiplication as composition of linear maps.

            <in>
                `[AB]_(ij) = sum_(k=1)^n [A]_(ik) \ [B]_(kj)`
            </in>

            The process of matrix multiplication is perhaps best thought of as computing the dot product of the
            `i` <sup>th</sup> row in `A` with the `j` <sup>th</sup> column in `B`, then storing the result in `[AB]_(ij)`.

            <b>N.B.</b> matrix multiplication is <b>not</b> commutative. (`AB != BA` in general)

            <h4>Properties</h4>

            <in> &nbsp;
                `A(BC) = (AB)C` &nbsp; (<span class="blue">associativity</span>)
                `A(B + C) = AB + AC` &nbsp; (first <span class="blue">distributive</span> law)
                `(A + B)C = AC + BC` &nbsp; (second <span class="blue">distributive</span> law)
            </in>
        </in>
