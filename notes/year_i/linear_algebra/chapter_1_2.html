        <h3>Equation of line</h3>

        <in> &nbsp;
            `bb v = bb a + lambda bb d`
            `bb v = bb a + lambda \ (bb b - bb a)`
            `bb v = (1 - lambda) \ bb a  + lambda bb b`

        </in>

        For a line segment, simply restrict `lambda` to `0 <= lambda <= 1`.

        <h4>Cross product alternative</h4>

        <in> &nbsp;
            `bb v xx bb d = bb a xx bb d`

            (see notes on cross product)

            <b>N.B.</b> Be careful not to confuse this with the equation of a plane (see below).
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Distance between lines</h3>
        
        Consider two lines, `l_1` and `l_2`, respectively:

        <in>
            `bb v = bb a + lambda bb c`
            `bb w = bb b + mu bb d`
        </in>

        Then the general displacement vector from a point on `l_1` to  a
        point on `l_2` would be:

        <in>
            `bb g = bb w - bb v = (bb b - bb a) + mu bb d - lambda bb c`
        </in>

        Since the line joining the closest points on each line must be
        orthogonal to both the original lines, we can use the dot product
        to find these points.
        
        <in>
            `bb g * bb v = 0`
            `bb g * bb w = 0`
        </in>

        Then simply solve the resulting simultaneous equations for `lambda` and `mu`.

        <h3>Equation of a plane</h3>

        <in> &nbsp;
            `bb v = bb a + lambda bb d + mu bb e`
            `bb v = bb a + lambda \ (bb b - bb a) + mu \ (bb c - bb a)` &nbsp; (for position vectors `bb a`, `bb b` and `bb c`)
            `bb v = (1 - lambda - mu) \ bb a + lambda bb b + mu bb c`
        </in>

        Alternatively, the dot product can be used to describe a plane:

        <in>
            `(bb v - bb a) * bb n = 0`
            `bb v * bb n = bb a * bb n = d`

            where `bb n` is a <i>normal</i> vector (a vector that is perpendicular
            to the plane).
        </in>

        An advantage of the latter representation is that it lends itself to translation
        into a Cartesian equation.

        <in>
            Let `bb n = [(a), (b ), (c)]` and `bb v = [(x), (y), (z)]`.
            
            `bb v * bb n = bb a * bb n \ \ => \ \ ax + by + cz = d`
            
            for some constant `d`.
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Distance between parallel planes</h3>

        Planes `Pi_1` and `Pi_2` are parallel. &nbsp; `<=>` &nbsp; Planes `Pi_1` and `Pi_2` share a normal vector `bb n`.

        Pick some point `A` on `Pi_1` with position vector `bb a`, then find `lambda` such that `bb a + lambda bb n`
        is the position vector of some point on `Pi_2`.

        Consider the following two planes

        <in>
            `bb v_1 * bb n = d_1`
            `bb v_2 * bb n = d_2`

            (<b>N.B.</b> the same normal vector)
        </in>
            
        Substitute `bb a + lambda bb n` for `bb v_2`:

        <in>
            `bb a * bb n + lambda |bb n|^2 = d_2`
        </in>

        ... and `bb a` for `bb v_1` (giving `d_1 = bb a * bb n`):

        <in>
            `lambda = (d_2 - d_1)/|bb n|^2`
        </in>

        The distance between our planes is the distance between our points
        `bb a` and `bb a + lambda bb n` &nbsp; (i.e., `|lambda bb n|` ):

        <in>
            `|lambda bb n| = |d_2 - d_1| / |bb n|`
            &nbsp;
        </in>

        <h3>Distance between plane and point</h3>

        Similarly, to find the distance between a plane and a <i>point</i> with
        position vector `bb g`, we may construct a parallel plane containing `bb g`:

        <in>
            `bb v_1 * bb n = bb g * bb n = h` &nbsp; (plane contructed around `bb g`)
            `bb v_2 * bb n = d` &nbsp; (another plane)
        </in>

        The distance between these two planes would then be:

        <in>
            `|d-h|/|bb n|`
        </in>

        A special case of this is the distance between the <i>origin</i> and a plane:

        <in>
            `|d|/|bb n|`
        </in>
